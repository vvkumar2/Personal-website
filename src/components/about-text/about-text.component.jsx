            Iâ€™m a sophomore Computer Science student at UCLA, and I really enjoy working with and learning cutting-edge technologies.
            Over the past few years, I have done this by developing important scripts and websites that were adopted at large corporations, and by taking online courses to supplement my college course load. 
            <br /><br />
            I have experience in various forms of web development, creating and managing backends, scripting in several languages, leveraging Python libraries to create neural networks, and much more. 
            <br /><br />
            I am excited by the plethora of new technologies being developed and the challenges to come as my career unfolds.
