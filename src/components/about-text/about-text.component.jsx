          I’m a senior Computer Science student at UCLA with a strong passion for working with and learning about cutting-edge technologies. Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to develop impactful scripts and websites that have been adopted by large corporations. I’ve also taken numerous online courses to enhance my college education and stay ahead of the curve in the tech world.
          <br /><br />
          I have hands-on experience in various aspects of web development, from creating and managing backends to scripting in multiple languages. I’ve also leveraged Python libraries to build neural networks and tackle complex challenges in AI and machine learning.
          <br /><br />
          As I continue to grow in my career, I’m excited about the endless possibilities new technologies offer and the challenges they present. I look forward to contributing to innovative projects and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
